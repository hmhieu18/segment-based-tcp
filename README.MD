# Test Case Prioritization

To rerun Test Case Prioritization for all test cases and all comparing methods, please follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Test Case Prioritization

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the Test Case Prioritization using the following command:

```bash
python3 ranker_revised.py
```

This command will execute the `ranker_revised.py` script, which is responsible for prioritizing test cases based on the specified methods.

Note: Ensure that you are in the correct directory where the `ranker_revised.py` script is located.

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues or have further questions!
